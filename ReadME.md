## Start Your Web3 Journey  

This is a **Stellar Soroban learning repository using Rust**.

We will begin by setting up Rust and covering some basic Rust concepts.

### Install Rust

To get Rust, please visit [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org).

After installing Rust, you can verify your installation by running:

```sh
rustc -V
rustc --version
cargo --version
cargo -V
```

These commands should return version information for `rustc` (the Rust compiler) and `cargo` (Rust's package manager). You may need to restart your terminal to ensure the newly installed commands are recognized by your system.

### Learn Rust Basics

We recommend starting with the Rustlings course, which you can find here: [Rustlings GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/).

To use the Rustlings course, run:

```sh
cargo install rustlings
rustlings init
cd rustlings/
rustlings
```

### Choosing an IDE

For a comfortable Rust development experience, you can use **RustRover**, which is currently free for non-commercial use. Alternatively, you can use **VS Code**, **Zed**, **Vim**, **Sublime Text**, or any other editor you prefer.

### Learn About Cargo

**Cargo** is Rust's package manager and build system. Although you can compile Rust code using `rustc`, using `cargo build` is more convenient for larger projects with dependencies.

### Getting Started with Stellar

To get started with Stellar and set up the environment, visit: [Stellar Developers - Getting Started](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/getting-started/setup). This page also includes instructions on how to install the Stellar CLI.

## First Contract

For your first project, follow the tutorial here: [Stellar Hello World Contract](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/getting-started/hello-world).

This tutorial helps you create a simple contract and explains the structure. In this repository, you can find it under `stellarCLI/soroban-hello-world`.

### Generate Your First Contract

If you have already installed the Stellar CLI, you can generate a Stellar CLI project using:

```sh
stellar contract init soroban-hello-world
```

### Understanding `Cargo.toml` and Rust Workspaces

`Cargo.toml` is a configuration file used in Rust projects. It allows you to manage dependencies and define project metadata.

A **Rust workspace** is a feature of Cargo that allows you to manage multiple packages within a single project. This is useful when building larger applications with multiple smart contracts or libraries.
