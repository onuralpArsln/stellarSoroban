Cargo is a package manager lik nuget pip npm luarocks but for rust

it has commands like cargo new project_name to generate a new project
cargo build to build and cargo run to run

so if ve have a rustc why use cargo build ? 
it is beacuse cargo build better works when there are many dependecies
lib.rs libraryr geliştirmek için main.rs uygulama geliştirmek için
lib.rs oluşturmak için cargo new projec_name --lib 

you can add a lib.rs to your application with main.rs so your project can be used as a stand alone tool or a lib

you use your lib.rs by using "use name_in_cargo.toml::{func_names}"

after using your lib.rs funcs inside main.rs you can cargo build and then cargo run
